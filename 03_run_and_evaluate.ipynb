    "Steps to follow:\n",
    "1) Clarify location, timeframe, and devices if missing; state any assumptions.\n",
    "2) Pull relevant data using tools: weather for solar/thermal context, electricity prices for time-of-use windows, usage and solar history for trends, recent summary when timeframe is unclear, and energy tips for best practices.\n",
    "3) Analyze patterns (peaks, off-peak windows, forecasted conditions) and decide the best actions.\n",
    "4) Quantify impact (kWh and USD) with calculate_energy_savings when numbers are available; otherwise give conservative ranges.\n",
    "5) Present 2-4 prioritized recommendations with reasoning and next steps; note gaps and ask one concise follow-up question if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key capabilities:\n",
    "- get_weather_forecast: assess upcoming conditions and solar potential.\n",
    "- get_electricity_prices: identify off-peak vs peak hours for load shifting.\n",
    "- query_energy_usage / query_solar_generation: inspect historical consumption and production.\n",
    "- get_recent_energy_summary: get a quick view when the user provides little context.\n",
    "- search_energy_tips: retrieve best practices via RAG.\n",
    "- calculate_energy_savings: quantify savings for proposed actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations guidance:\n",
    "- Tie every suggestion to retrieved data (price periods, forecast, usage patterns) and make them specific and time-bound.\n",
    "- Prefer scheduling and load shifting to cheaper hours; suggest thermostat, EV, appliance, and solar-usage tweaks.\n",
    "- Include expected savings and assumptions; provide quick wins plus one longer-term improvement when relevant.\n",
    "- If data is missing, state the assumption and request the needed detail succinctly.\n",

    "- \"Given this week's forecast, when should I run my dishwasher to save the most?\"\n",

      "### Summary of Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Weather Forecast for Tomorrow (October 7, 2023)**:\n",
      "   - The day is expected to be **cloudy** with no solar irradiance forecasted throughout the day. This means solar generation will be minimal or non-existent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Electricity Prices**:\n",
      "   - **Off-Peak Rates**: \n",
      "     - 12 AM - 5 AM: $0.077 - $0.085 per kWh\n",
      "     - 10 PM - 11 PM: $0.082 - $0.084 per kWh\n",
      "   - **Peak Rates**:\n",
      "     - 6 AM - 9 PM: $0.155 - $0.165 per kWh\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **EV Usage Data**:\n",
      "   - No recent records of EV charging were found for the past week, indicating either minimal usage or lack of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the lack of solar generation and the time-of-use pricing structure, here are the prioritized recommendations for charging your electric vehicle (EV):\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Charge your EV between **12 AM - 5 AM** or **10 PM - 11 PM** when the rates are lowest (as low as $0.077 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Expected Savings**: Charging during these hours can save you significantly compared to peak rates, which can be as high as $0.165 per kWh.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consider Charging Overnight**:\n",
      "   - If you can, set your EV to charge overnight (e.g., starting at 12 AM). This will ensure you take advantage of the lowest rates and avoid peak pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Monitor Future Solar Generation**:\n",
      "   - While tomorrow's forecast shows no solar potential, keep an eye on future forecasts. On sunnier days, consider charging during the day when solar generation is available to further reduce costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "- Set your EV to charge during the recommended off-peak hours.\n",
      "- If you have a programmable charger, schedule it to start at midnight.\n",
      "- Monitor your energy usage in the coming days to adjust your charging habits based on solar generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Question\n",
      "Would you like to know about any specific energy-saving tips for your home appliances or HVAC system?\n"

Given the heatwave conditions, here are some recommendations for setting your thermostat to stay comfortable while minimizing costs:\\n\\n### Current Conditions:\\n- **Peak Temperature**: 20°C (68°F) around 5 PM\\n- **Electricity Rates**: Peak rates from 6 PM to 8 PM are approximately $0.157 to $0.165 per kWh.\\n\\n### Recommendations:\\n1. **Set Thermostat to 24°C (75°F)**:\\n   - **Reasoning**: This temperature is generally comfortable during warm weather and will help reduce cooling costs compared to lower settings.\\n   - **Timing**: Maintain this setting until around 5 PM when the temperature peaks.\\n\\n2. **Increase Temperature Setting to 26°C (78°F) After 5 PM**:\\n   - **Reasoning**: As the temperature peaks, raising the thermostat will help reduce energy consumption during the most expensive peak hours.\\n   - **Expected Savings**: By increasing the temperature setting, you can save approximately 10-15% on cooling costs during peak hours.\\n\\n3. **Utilize Fans**:\\n   - **Reasoning**: Use ceiling or portable fans to circulate air, which can make higher temperatures feel more comfortable without over-relying on the AC.\\n   - **Expected Impact**: This can reduce the need for cooling by about 2-5 degrees, allowing you to set the thermostat higher.\\n\\n4. **Consider Time-of-Use Shifting**:\\n   - **Reasoning**: If you have appliances that can be run later (like dishwashers or laundry), schedule them for after 8 PM when rates drop to off-peak levels (around $0.08 per kWh).\\n   - **Expected Savings**: This can save you about 50% on energy costs for those appliances.\\n\\n### Next Steps:\\n- Adjust your thermostat settings as recommended.\\n- Monitor your comfort level and adjust as necessary.\\n- Consider using fans to enhance comfort without increasing cooling costs.\\n\\nIf you have any specific devices or appliances you want to optimize further, please let me know!')]},\n",

Solar generation is likely to start around 4 PM.\\n2. **Electricity Prices**: Tomorrow's electricity rates indicate peak pricing from 6 AM to 8 PM, with the highest rates occurring between 4 PM and 8 PM.\\n3. **Solar Generation**: There was no solar generation recorded yesterday, indicating a potential issue or low output from your solar system.\\n\\n### Recommendations to Maximize Solar Self-Consumption Tomorrow Afternoon\\n\\n1. **Delay High Energy Usage**: \\n   - **Action**: Postpone running high-energy appliances (like dishwashers, washing machines, or dryers) until after 4 PM when solar generation is expected to begin.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This will allow you to utilize solar energy instead of drawing from the grid during peak pricing hours (4 PM - 8 PM).\\n   - **Expected Impact**: By shifting usage to solar generation hours, you can avoid peak rates of approximately $0.165 per kWh.\\n\\n2. **Monitor Solar Output**:\\n   - **Action**: If possible, check your solar system's output starting at 4 PM to ensure it is generating energy. If it is not, consider reducing your load further.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This will help you adjust your energy consumption based on actual solar generation, maximizing self-consumption.\\n\\n3. **Use Battery Storage (if available)**:\\n   - **Action**: If you have a battery storage system, charge it during the day (if solar generation occurs) and use it during peak hours.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This can help you avoid high grid costs and utilize stored solar energy when needed.\\n\\n4. **Adjust Thermostat Settings**:\\n   - **Action**: If you have a smart thermostat, consider setting it to run heating or cooling systems during the afternoon when solar generation is expected.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This can help you use solar energy for heating/cooling instead of relying on the grid.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n- **Monitor Weather and Solar Output**: Keep an eye on the weather and your solar output starting in the afternoon.\\n- **Plan Appliance Use**: Schedule your high-energy appliances for after 4 PM.\\n- **Consider Battery Use**: If you have battery storage, ensure it is charged and ready for use during peak hours.\\n\\n### Follow-Up Question\\nDo you have a battery storage system installed with your solar setup?\")]},\n",
