    "Steps to follow:\n",
    "1) Clarify location, timeframe, and devices if missing; state any assumptions.\n",
    "2) Pull relevant data using tools: weather for solar/thermal context, electricity prices for time-of-use windows, usage and solar history for trends, recent summary when timeframe is unclear, and energy tips for best practices.\n",
    "3) Analyze patterns (peaks, off-peak windows, forecasted conditions) and decide the best actions.\n",
    "4) Quantify impact (kWh and USD) with calculate_energy_savings when numbers are available; otherwise give conservative ranges.\n",
    "5) Present 2-4 prioritized recommendations with reasoning and next steps; note gaps and ask one concise follow-up question if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key capabilities:\n",
    "- get_weather_forecast: assess upcoming conditions and solar potential.\n",
    "- get_electricity_prices: identify off-peak vs peak hours for load shifting.\n",

    "- get_recent_energy_summary: get a quick view when the user provides little context.\n",
    "- search_energy_tips: retrieve best practices via RAG.\n",
    "- calculate_energy_savings: quantify savings for proposed actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations guidance:\n",
    "- Tie every suggestion to retrieved data (price periods, forecast, usage patterns) and make them specific and time-bound.\n",
    "- Prefer scheduling and load shifting to cheaper hours; suggest thermostat, EV, appliance, and solar-usage tweaks.\n",
    "- Include expected savings and assumptions; provide quick wins plus one longer-term improvement when relevant.\n",
    "- If data is missing, state the assumption and request the needed detail succinctly.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Weather Forecast**: The day is expected to be cloudy with no solar irradiance during the day. Solar generation is expected to be minimal.\n",
      "2. **Electricity Prices**:\n",
      "   - **Peak Hours (6 AM - 8 PM)**: Rates range from $0.175 to $0.185 per kWh.\n",
      "   - **Off-Peak Hours (9 PM - 5 AM)**: Rates are significantly lower, ranging from $0.096 to $0.105 per kWh.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Charging Your Electric Vehicle (EV)\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Charge During Off-Peak Hours**:\n",
      "   - **Best Time**: Charge your EV between **9 PM and 5 AM** when the rates are at their lowest (around $0.096 to $0.105 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Reasoning**: Charging during these hours will save you money as the rates are significantly lower compared to peak hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid Daytime Charging**:\n",
      "   - **Peak Hours**: Avoid charging between **6 AM and 8 PM** due to higher rates (up to $0.185 per kWh) and minimal solar generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Next Steps\n",
      "- Schedule your EV charging to start at **9 PM** on December 29, 2025, and finish by **5 AM** on December 30, 2025, to take full advantage of the off-peak rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-Up Question\n",
      "Do you have a specific charging capacity or time duration for your EV that I should consider for this schedule?\n"

       "    AIMessage(content=\"### Summary of Findings\\n1. **Weather Forecast**: Tomorrow in San Francisco will be cloudy with no solar irradiance expected until late afternoon. Solar generation is projected to start around 4 PM, peaking at 6 PM.\\n2. **Electricity Prices**: The peak pricing period is from 6 AM to 8 PM, with rates ranging from $0.179 to $0.185 per kWh. Off-peak rates are significantly lower, starting at $0.096 after 10 PM.\\n3. **Solar Generation**: No solar generation data is available for tomorrow, indicating that your system may not have produced energy in the past or is not operational.\\n\\n### Recommendations to Maximize Solar Self-Consumption\\n1. **Delay High Energy Usage**: \\n   - **Action**: Postpone running high-energy appliances (like dishwashers, washing machines, or EV charging) until after 4 PM when solar generation begins.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This will allow you to utilize solar energy instead of drawing from the grid during peak pricing hours.\\n   - **Expected Impact**: If you can shift 5 kWh of usage to the afternoon, you could save approximately $0.90 (5 kWh * $0.179).\\n\\n2. **Optimize Appliance Scheduling**:\\n   - **Action**: Schedule your dishwasher and laundry to run between 4 PM and 8 PM.\\n   - **Reasoning**: This timing aligns with the expected solar generation, reducing reliance on grid electricity.\\n   - **Expected Impact**: If these appliances typically consume 3 kWh each, you could save around $0.54 (3 kWh * $0.179) for each appliance run during solar generation.\\n\\n3. **Monitor Solar Production**:\\n   - **Action**: Keep an eye on your solar production starting at 4 PM to adjust your energy usage accordingly.\\n   - **Reasoning**: If solar generation is higher than expected, you can increase your usage of appliances.\\n   - **Expected Impact**: This could further reduce your grid draw and maximize savings.\\n\\n### Next Steps\\n- Implement the scheduling changes for your appliances.\\n- Monitor your solar generation starting at 4 PM to adjust your usage dynamically.\\n- Consider checking your solar system's operational status if no generation data is available.\\n\\n### Follow-Up Question\\nDo you have any specific appliances you plan to run tomorrow that I should consider for scheduling?\")]},\n",
