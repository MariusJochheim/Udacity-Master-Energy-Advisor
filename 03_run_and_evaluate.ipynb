    "Always-first tool policy (no invented numbers):\n",
    "- Call tools before giving any numeric or time-bound guidance. Weather/prices/usage/solar → relevant tool; tips-only queries → search_energy_tips.\n",
    "- If a tool is missing or returns nothing, say so, state the gap, and ask for what you need. Do not fabricate values or probabilities.\n",
    "- When numbers are provided or fetched, recompute with calculate_energy_savings to produce kWh/USD impacts; if inputs are insufficient, give conservative ranges and note assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1) Clarify location, timeframe, devices if missing; list any assumptions explicitly.\n",
    "2) Pull relevant data using tools: get_weather_forecast (solar/thermal context), get_electricity_prices (off- vs on-peak hours), query_energy_usage/query_solar_generation (history), get_recent_energy_summary (when timeframe is unclear), search_energy_tips (best practices), calculate_energy_savings (quantify impact).\n",
    "3) Analyze patterns (peaks, off-peak windows, forecasted conditions) and decide the best actions tied to tool outputs.\n",
    "4) Present 2-4 prioritized recommendations with timing and expected savings; include one concise follow-up question only if needed.\n",

      "### Data Checked:\n",
      "- **Weather Forecast for San Francisco, CA (October 7, 2023)**:\n",
      "  - Cloudy conditions throughout the day.\n",
      "  - No solar irradiance expected, indicating no solar power generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Electricity Prices (October 7, 2023)**:\n",
      "  - **Off-Peak Rates**:\n",
      "    - 12 AM - 5 AM: $0.077 - $0.085 per kWh\n",
      "    - 10 PM - 11 PM: $0.082 - $0.084 per kWh\n",
      "  - **Peak Rates**:\n",
      "    - 6 AM - 9 PM: $0.155 - $0.165 per kWh\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Solar Generation**:\n",
      "  - No solar generation recorded for October 6-7, indicating that charging during the day will not benefit from solar power.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Charge Overnight (12 AM - 5 AM)**:\n",
      "   - **Timing**: Start charging your EV at 12 AM and finish by 5 AM.\n",
      "   - **Cost**: Charging during this period will cost between $0.077 and $0.085 per kWh.\n",
      "   - **Assumption**: Assuming a typical EV battery capacity of 60 kWh, charging fully would cost approximately $4.62 to $5.10.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Avoid Daytime Charging (6 AM - 9 PM)**:\n",
      "   - **Timing**: Do not charge your EV during peak hours when rates are significantly higher ($0.155 - $0.165 per kWh).\n",
      "   - **Impact**: Charging during peak hours could cost approximately $9.30 to $9.90 for a full charge, which is more than double the overnight cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Charge Late Evening (10 PM - 11 PM)**:\n",
      "   - **Timing**: If you miss the overnight window, consider charging late in the evening at $0.082 - $0.084 per kWh.\n",
      "   - **Cost**: This would still be cheaper than daytime rates but more expensive than the overnight rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Monitor Future Solar Generation**:\n",
      "   - **Action**: Keep an eye on solar forecasts for future days to optimize charging when solar generation is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Follow-up:\n",
      "Would you like to know more about optimizing your energy usage for other devices?\n"

If you usually set it to 22°C (72°F), the difference could save you around $0.50-$1.00 depending on your usage.\\n   \\n2. **Increase Thermostat to 26°C (79°F) from 4 PM to 8 PM**:\\n   - **Impact**: As temperatures cool slightly, this setting will help reduce energy consumption during peak pricing hours.\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Running at this higher setting for 4 hours at an average peak rate of $0.16/kWh would cost about $1.28, potentially saving you $0.50 compared to a lower setting.\\n\\n3. **Utilize Fans for Circulation**:\\n   - **Impact**: Use ceiling or portable fans to enhance comfort without over-relying on the AC. This can allow you to set the thermostat a few degrees higher.\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: Fans use significantly less energy (about 0.1-0.2 kWh per hour), which can save you $0.10-$0.20 per hour compared to running the AC alone.\\n\\n4. **Avoid Cooking During Peak Hours**:\\n   - **Impact**: Cooking can increase indoor temperatures, making your AC work harder. Opt for no-cook meals or use a microwave.\\n   - **Estimated Savings**: This can help reduce the overall cooling load, potentially saving you an additional $0.50-$1.00 during peak hours.\\n\\n### Follow-up:\\nWould you like more detailed energy-saving tips for specific appliances or devices?')]},\n",
