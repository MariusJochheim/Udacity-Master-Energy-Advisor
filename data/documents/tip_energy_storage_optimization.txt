Energy Storage Optimization
- Configure battery dispatch to shave peak demand charges and follow time-of-use price signals.
- Reserve a backup state-of-charge buffer while using the remaining capacity for daily cycling.
- Align battery charging with surplus solar production and discharging with evening ramps.
- Limit high C-rate charging/discharging when temperatures are extreme to extend battery lifespan.
- Use state-of-health analytics to adjust depth-of-discharge limits as cells age.
- Coordinate storage with load control (HVAC preconditioning, EV charging) for stacked savings.
