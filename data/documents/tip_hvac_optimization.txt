HVAC Optimization Strategies
- Schedule regular filter replacements to keep airflow unobstructed and avoid compressor overwork.
- Use smart thermostats with occupancy detection to trim setpoints in unoccupied zones without manual intervention.
- Seal and insulate ducts in attics or crawl spaces to reduce thermal losses and improve delivered BTU efficiency.
- Enable economizer or “free cooling” modes when outdoor air meets temperature and humidity targets.
- Stage or modulate compressors and fans rather than running single-speed units at full load.
- Commission systems seasonally to recalibrate setpoints, verify refrigerant charge, and balance airflow.
