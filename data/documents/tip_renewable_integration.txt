Renewable Energy Integration
- Right-size PV arrays by matching production to daytime loads and storage capacity to avoid curtailment.
- Use load shifting (water heating, HVAC precooling) to consume solar output when generation peaks.
- Configure inverters for voltage ride-through and grid-support modes to improve interconnection stability.
- Combine solar with heat pump water heaters to convert excess kWh into stored thermal energy.
- Track utility export tariffs and adjust self-consumption targets when feed-in rates change.
- Maintain clear shading paths and clean modules to preserve expected capacity factor over time.
