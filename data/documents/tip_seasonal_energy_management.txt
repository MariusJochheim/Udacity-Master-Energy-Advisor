Seasonal Energy Management
- In summer, precool during off-peak hours and tighten blinds to cut solar heat gain in the afternoon.
- In winter, use programmable setbacks at night and open south-facing blinds to capture passive solar heat.
- Adjust ceiling fan direction: counterclockwise in summer for cooling, clockwise in winter for destratification.
- Service HVAC and heat pump defrost cycles before seasonal peaks to maintain coefficient of performance.
- Calibrate humidification/dehumidification targets to reduce latent loads and improve comfort efficiency.
- Update irrigation schedules seasonally to avoid overwatering and wasted pump energy.
